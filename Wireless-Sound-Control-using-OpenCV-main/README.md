# Wireless-Sound-Control-using-OpenCV
This project leverages OpenCV for real-time visual processing to enable wireless control of sound. It recognizes gestures or objects through computer vision, triggering corresponding sound events. The integration of wireless communication allows remote control of audio devices.
# Features
Real-time visual analysis using OpenCV.
Gesture and object recognition for sound triggers.
Seamless wireless communication for remote sound control.
# Getting Started
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Maverik10/Wireless-Sound-Control.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script: python main.py
# Usage
Customize gesture/object recognition in config.yml.
Ensure a compatible camera is connected for real-time visual input.
