# Hand Gesture Volume Control
This project utilizes computer vision techniques to control the system's volume based on hand gestures detected through a webcam. It employs the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing.

# Installation
#   Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-volume-control.git
# Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage
Run the main script:

python hand_gesture_volume_control.py
1. Ensure that your webcam is correctly set up and facing your hand.

2. Perform hand gestures in front of the webcam to control the volume:

    Pinch gesture: Increase volume
    Stretch gesture: Decrease volume
3. Press 'q' to exit the program.
